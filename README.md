## 💻 Development of the guides <a name="description"></a>
### [Guide 1](https://github.com/just-juanma/Guides-EDI1/tree/master/Guia_1)
The objective is to be able to demonstrate the weights of variables in memory, data types, printout formats, and pass-through from one base to another. In addition, the sum of signed binary numbers is taken into account. It is checked if a carry, borrow or overflow occurs.
### [Guide 2](https://github.com/just-juanma/Guides-EDI1/tree/master/Guide_2)
I worked with binary logic operators, masks and shifts (left, right) 

## ⬇️ How to Install and Run the Project <a name="howto"></a>

To use the project, I debug it using [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) in C/C++ language. I understand that depending on the version of this IDE there may be conflicts.

## ⚠️ Considerations <a name="considerations"></a>

No error control, since I do not consider it necessary.

## ©️ License <a name="license"></a>
