## 💻 Project Description <a name="description"></a>

The objective is to be able to demonstrate the weights of variables in memory, data types, printout formats, and pass-through from one base to another.

## ⬇️ How to Install and Run the Project <a name="howto"></a>

To use the project, we debug it using Visual Studio 2022 Community in C/C++ language. I understand that depending on the version of this IDE there may be conflicts.

No error control, since I do not consider it necessary.
